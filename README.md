# Supporting the Project
### Partnerships & Collaborations
LiveVisionKit is currently focussed on providing purpose-built tools for remote IRL streaming. If you are an established IRL streamer, I'm interested in collaborating to find out how LiveVisionKit can be best configured and improved to fit your needs. Please contact me through the email listed below. 

**Business Contact:** crowsinc.dev@gmail.com

### Sponsorships
Making a single real-time computer vision filter can take well over 300 hours of research, experimentation, development, optimisation, testing and tweaking. If you depend on LiveVisionKit, please consider donating through one of the services listed below. This goes towards the creation of new filters as well as the continuous improvement of existing functionality.
