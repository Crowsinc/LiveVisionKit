LiveVisionKit (LVK) is a set of real-time video processing filters for manipulating and enhancing livestreams or recorded videos. Features include video stabilization, adaptive de-blocking, lens correction, image enhancement, and more. LiveVisionKit may be used via the OBS-Studio plugin, with more options coming in the future!

# Supporting the Project
Each LiveVisionKit filter is engineered from the ground up using state of the art computer vision, image processing, and AI techniques. This is a costly process which takes hundreds of working hours across various stages of research, experimentation, development, testing, and optimization.
