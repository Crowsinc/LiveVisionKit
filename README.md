LiveVisionKit is an OBS Studio plugin designed to provide streamers with purpose built tools for enhancing their remote IRL streams. Such streams make use of portable 'IRL backpacks' that capture and transmit footage to an OBS server where it is re-broadcasted to a streaming service such as Twitch. The quality of the stream is primarily constrained by the IRL backpack. Its portability limits the quality of the recording set up, while its processing power and network connection directly control the visual quality of the stream. LiveVisionKit runs on the OBS server, where its filters aim to reduce the effect of these limitations by adding new recording capabilities and improving the visual quality of the stream.
